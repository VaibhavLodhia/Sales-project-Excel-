# Sales-project-Excel

In this project, I made a sales report using fancy Excel tools that help businesses figure out cool discounts for customers, talk better deals, and find new chances to grow in awesome countries. The reports I made give smart ideas and tips to make businesses sell things better, make customers happy, and earn more money.

I learned these things:

    How to use pivot tables (fancy way to organize info)
    Power Query (a tool to make info look nice)
    DAX (kind of like math for info)
    Making things look pretty with colors
    Making reports look awesome
    Important sales numbers

Overall, this project is like giving businesses superpowers to watch, think about, and make sales better. When businesses look at sales info, they can find cool new things to do, grow big, and be awesome in a busy market.
